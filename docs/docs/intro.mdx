# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Fluid simulation library in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Install all packages

```bash
yarn install
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run site with demos.

## Build Fluid simulation library

// Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

In root of the project use this command:

```bash
yarn build:lib
```
or go to lib directory and run build command:

```bash
cd lib
yarn build
```
The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

## How to run website with examples

Run the development server:

```bash
cd docs
yarn start
```

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.

## How to use library

In **docs** folder you can create personal component with demo application like BasicDemo or SphereDemo.
